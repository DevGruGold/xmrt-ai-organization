# XMRT DAO Prototype Architecture Plan

## 1. Core Components

The XMRT DAO prototype will consist of several key components working in conjunction to provide a fully automated AI organization. These components are:

*   **Frontend Interface:** A professionally stylized web interface for user interaction with the DAO and Eliza AI agents.
*   **Backend Services:** A set of APIs and services to handle business logic, data storage, and communication between the frontend and other components.
*   **Eliza AI Agents:** Autonomous AI agents responsible for organizational management, decision-making, and interaction within the XMRT ecosystem.
*   **Blockchain Integration Module:** A module responsible for interacting with the Sepolia Testnet, including token transfers and smart contract interactions.
*   **IPFS/Decentralized Storage:** For storing immutable data, such as DAO proposals, voting results, and potentially AI agent knowledge bases.
*   **XMRT Project Repository:** The central GitHub repository (`DevGruGold/xmrt-ai-organization`) that will host the entire codebase and documentation.




## 2. Component Interactions

The interactions between these components will be orchestrated to ensure seamless operation of the XMRT DAO:

*   **User to Frontend:** Users will interact with the DAO through the web-based frontend. This includes viewing DAO proposals, voting, managing their XMRT tokens, and interacting with Eliza AI agents.
*   **Frontend to Backend:** The frontend will communicate with the backend services via RESTful APIs or GraphQL. These requests will handle user authentication, data retrieval, and triggering backend processes.
*   **Backend to Eliza AI Agents:** The backend will serve as an intermediary for Eliza AI agents. It will provide the necessary data for the agents to operate, receive their outputs (e.g., decisions, proposals), and facilitate their communication with the blockchain or other external services. This interaction will likely involve a message queue or an event-driven architecture to handle asynchronous communication.
*   **Eliza AI Agents to Blockchain Integration Module:** Eliza AI agents, when making decisions that require on-chain actions (e.g., executing a proposal, transferring tokens), will communicate with the Blockchain Integration Module. This module will then interact with the Sepolia Testnet smart contracts.
*   **Blockchain Integration Module to Sepolia Testnet:** This module will be responsible for sending transactions to the Sepolia Testnet, querying token balances, and listening for relevant smart contract events. It will interact with the `0x77307DFbc436224d5e6f2048d2b6bDfA66998a15` XMRT token contract.
*   **Backend/Eliza AI Agents to IPFS/Decentralized Storage:** Important DAO data, such as proposals, voting records, and potentially Eliza AI agent knowledge bases or audit trails, will be stored on IPFS or a similar decentralized storage solution to ensure immutability and transparency. The backend or Eliza agents will handle the uploading and retrieval of this data.




## 3. Sepolia Testnet Token Integration

The XMRT token on the Sepolia Testnet (`0x77307DFbc436224d5e6f2048d2b6bDfA66998a15`) will be central to the DAO's operations. The integration will involve:

*   **Token Balance and Transfer:** The Blockchain Integration Module will provide functionalities to check user and DAO contract token balances and facilitate token transfers as per DAO decisions.
*   **Smart Contract Interaction:** The DAO will likely have a governance smart contract deployed on Sepolia that manages proposals, voting, and execution of approved actions. The Blockchain Integration Module will interact with this contract to submit proposals, cast votes, and trigger execution functions.
*   **Event Listening:** The system will listen for events emitted by the XMRT token contract and the DAO governance contract to update the frontend and trigger Eliza AI agent actions (e.g., a new proposal being created, a vote passing).
*   **Proof Generation (Risc0/Noir):** While `xmrt-risc0-proofs` and `xmrt-noir` were not found as direct repositories, the mention implies the use of zero-knowledge proofs. These technologies will be integrated into the Blockchain Integration Module or a dedicated ZKP service to provide verifiable computation for certain DAO operations, enhancing transparency and security. This could involve proving the correctness of Eliza AI agent decisions or the validity of off-chain computations before on-chain execution.




## 4. Overall Architecture and Data Flow

The XMRT DAO architecture will follow a modular and scalable design, allowing for future expansion and integration of new features. The data flow will generally be as follows:

1.  **User Interaction:** Users initiate actions via the Frontend Interface (e.g., creating a proposal, casting a vote).
2.  **Frontend to Backend API:** User actions are sent to the Backend Services via API calls.
3.  **Backend Processing:** The Backend Services process the request, validate it, and interact with relevant internal modules or external services.
4.  **Eliza AI Agent Involvement:** For actions requiring autonomous decision-making or complex logic, the Backend will engage Eliza AI Agents. Eliza agents will access necessary data (e.g., current DAO state, external market data) and generate decisions or recommendations.
5.  **Blockchain Interaction:** If an action requires on-chain execution (e.g., token transfer, smart contract call), the Backend or Eliza AI Agents will communicate with the Blockchain Integration Module.
6.  **Sepolia Testnet Execution:** The Blockchain Integration Module will interact with the Sepolia Testnet to execute transactions, query data, or listen for events related to the XMRT token and DAO smart contracts.
7.  **Decentralized Storage:** Important data, such as proposals, voting results, and audit trails of Eliza AI agent decisions, will be stored on IPFS/Decentralized Storage for immutability and transparency.
8.  **Data Synchronization and Feedback:** Changes on the blockchain or updates from Eliza AI Agents will be synchronized back to the Backend Services and reflected in the Frontend Interface, providing real-time feedback to users.

This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, enabling independent development and scaling of each component. The use of Eliza AI agents at the core of the DAO allows for autonomous and intelligent organizational management, while blockchain integration provides transparency, security, and decentralized governance.
